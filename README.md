# Compiler_Kotlin
Implementation of a scanner (for the lexical analysis phase) and a parser (for the syntactic analysis phase) for a simple subset of the Kotlin programming language.
The parser returns the abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the Kotlin
program given as input
This subset of Kotlin consists of one function main and the following expressions and commands:
• Expressions: arithmetic expressions; boolean expressions; the print function; the readln fuction;
• Commands: variable declarations and assignments; conditional expressions (if then else); while loops;
